# Accessibility Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document summarizes the accessibility improvements made to the BoilerFuel Calorie Tracker application to address the following issues:

1. ✅ ARIA hidden element must not be focusable or contain focusable elements
2. ✅ Documents must have `<title>` element to aid in navigation
3. ✅ `<html>` element must have a lang attribute
4. ✅ Document should have one main landmark

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Lang Attribute
**File: `frontend/pages/_app.js`**

- Added a `useEffect` hook that sets the `lang="en"` attribute on the `<html>` element
- This ensures screen readers know the page language and can pronounce content correctly

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Set lang attribute on html element
  if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
    document.documentElement.lang = 'en';
  }
}, []);
```

### 2. Page Titles
Added proper `<title>` elements to all pages using Next.js `Head` component:

#### **frontend/pages/index.jsx**
- Title: "BoilerFuel Calorie Tracker - Home"
- Meta description added for SEO

#### **frontend/pages/dashboard.jsx**
- Loading state: "Loading... - BoilerFuel Dashboard"
- Main view: "BoilerFuel Dashboard - Track Your Meals"
- Meta description added

#### **frontend/pages/admin.jsx**
- Loading state: "Loading... - Admin Panel"
- Login view: "Admin Login - BoilerFuel"
- Authenticated view: "Admin Panel - BoilerFuel"
- Meta descriptions added

### 3. ARIA Hidden Elements
**File: `frontend/pages/admin.jsx`**

- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative SVG icons in the password visibility toggle
- The parent button already has proper `aria-label` attributes for screen readers
- This prevents screen readers from announcing redundant decorative content

```jsx
<svg className="h-5 w-5" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true">
  {/* SVG content */}
</svg>
```

### 4. Main Landmarks
All pages already properly use `<main>` landmarks:
- ✅ `frontend/pages/index.jsx` - Has `<main>` wrapper
- ✅ `frontend/pages/dashboard.jsx` - Has `<main>` wrapper
- ✅ `frontend/pages/admin.jsx` - Has `<main>` wrapper for all states

## Benefits

These accessibility improvements provide:

1. **Better Screen Reader Support**: Users with screen readers can now properly navigate and understand the page structure
2. **Improved SEO**: Proper page titles and meta descriptions help search engines index the site
3. **Browser Tab Navigation**: Users can easily identify pages by their titles in browser tabs
4. **WCAG Compliance**: Moves the application closer to WCAG 2.1 Level A/AA compliance
5. **Better User Experience**: All users benefit from clear page titles and proper document structure

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. Use browser DevTools Lighthouse audit (Accessibility section)
2. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
3. Verify page titles appear in browser tabs
4. Check that HTML lang attribute is set using browser inspector

## Additional Accessibility Considerations

While these fixes address the immediate issues, consider these future improvements:

- Add skip navigation links for keyboard users
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Add focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
- Add ARIA labels to all form inputs (currently only some have them)
- Consider adding loading states with `aria-live` regions for dynamic content
