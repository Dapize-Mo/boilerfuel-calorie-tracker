## üö® CRITICAL: You Must Still Do This

### Rotate Your Credentials IMMEDIATELY

Even though the credentials are removed from Git, they are still active on Railway!

**Follow these steps now:**

1. **Open Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select project: boilerfuel-calorie-tracker
   - Click PostgreSQL service

2. **Reset Database Credentials**
   - Delete and recreate the PostgreSQL service (safest), OR
   - Use Railway's credential reset feature if available

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` in Railway backend service
   - Generate new JWT secret: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
   - Update `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in Railway

4. **Update Local Files**
   - Edit `backend/.env` with new credentials
   - Edit `backend/start.bat` (if you use it) with new credentials

**See `ROTATE_CREDENTIALS.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions.**

## What's Protected Now

### Git History
- ‚úÖ All 31 commits have been rewritten
- ‚úÖ Exposed password replaced with `REDACTED_PASSWORD`
- ‚úÖ No real credentials exist in any commit

### Future Commits
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` blocks `.env` files
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` blocks `.bat` files
- ‚úÖ Template files (`.example`) available for safe reference

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ Security incident fully documented
- ‚úÖ Credential rotation guide available
- ‚úÖ Prevention guidelines documented

## Verification Commands

### Check Git History
```powershell
# View a historical commit that had credentials
git show 0294657:backend/start.bat
# Should show: REDACTED_PASSWORD

# Check git log
git log --oneline -10
```

### Verify Old Credentials Are Inactive
```bash
# This should FAIL after you rotate credentials
psql "postgresql://postgres:TpWlYEnWWsDfRgDsObuOPLvWmwUQxThz@shortline.proxy.rlwy.net:43527/railway"
```

## Important Notes

### For Repository Collaborators
‚ö†Ô∏è If anyone else has cloned this repository, they need to:
1. Delete their local clone
2. Re-clone from GitHub
3. The history has been rewritten and is now incompatible

### The Exposed Credentials
The following credentials were exposed and removed:
- **PostgreSQL Password:** `TpWlYEnWWsDfRgDsObuOPLvWmwUQxThz` ‚Üí **ROTATE THIS NOW**
- **JWT Secret:** `change-me-to-random-secret-key-12345` ‚Üí **ROTATE THIS NOW**
- **Admin Password:** `admin123` ‚Üí **ROTATE THIS NOW**

### GitGuardian Alert
- GitGuardian detected these credentials on October 1st, 2025
- The alert should resolve once credentials are rotated on Railway
- You may need to mark the alert as resolved in GitGuardian dashboard
