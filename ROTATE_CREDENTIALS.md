## Step 1: Rotate Railway Database Credentials

### Go to Railway Dashboard

1. Open: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select project: **boilerfuel-calorie-tracker**
3. Click on your **PostgreSQL** service

### Option A: Create New Database (Safest)

1. Click "Settings" tab on PostgreSQL service
2. Scroll to bottom â†’ Click "Delete Service"
3. Confirm deletion
4. Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add PostgreSQL"
5. Copy the new `DATABASE_URL` from Variables tab
6. Update all services that use the database

### Option B: Change Password

If Railway provides password rotation:
1. Look for "Reset Credentials" or "Generate New Credentials"
2. Copy the new `DATABASE_URL`
3. Update all services

## Step 2: Update Environment Variables in Railway

### For Your Backend Service:

1. Click on your **backend/app** service in Railway
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Update these variables with new values:
   - `DATABASE_URL` â†’ Your new PostgreSQL URL
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` â†’ Generate new: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
4. Click "Deploy" to restart with new credentials

---

## Step 3: Update Local Development Environment

### Create Local .env File

```powershell
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

### Edit backend/.env

Replace with your NEW credentials:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:NEW_PASSWORD@shortline.proxy.rlwy.net:43527/railway
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-new-secret-key-here
```

### If Using start.bat

```powershell
cd backend
cp start.bat.example start.bat
```

Edit `backend/start.bat` with your new credentials.

---

## Step 4: Test the Changes

### Test Railway Deployment

1. Go to your Railway app URL
2. Try to log in / access the app
3. Check Railway logs for any database connection errors

### Test Local Development

```powershell
cd backend
python app.py
```

Visit: http://localhost:5000

## Step 5: Verify Old Credentials Are Dead

Try connecting with the OLD credentials to verify they no longer work:

```powershell
# This should FAIL
psql "postgresql://postgres:REDACTED_PASSWORD@shortline.proxy.rlwy.net:43527/railway"
```

If it still works, the old credentials are still active! Go back to Step 1.
